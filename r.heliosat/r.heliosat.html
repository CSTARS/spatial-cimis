<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<b>r.heliosat</b> computes integrated beam (direct), diffuse and ground reflected solar
irradiation raster maps for given day, region and atmospheric
conditions.

<p>Users can also select an instant time, and r.heliosat will compute the integrated value at that
  time.  Two calls to r.heliosat can then be used to calculate time-slices of irradiance that can be combined with
  cloud cover estimates to calculate non-clear sky estimations.</p>

<p> No shadowing from topography is included in the calculations.</p>

<p>The model computes all three components of global radiation (beam, 
diffuse and reflected) for the clear sky conditions, i.e. not taking into 
  consideration the spatial and temporal variation of clouds.</p>


<h2> OPTIONS</h2>
<p>Currently, there are two modes of r.sun.
In the first mode it calculates solar incidence angle and solar irradiance
raster maps using the set local time. In the second mode daily sums of solar
irradiation [Wh.m-2.day-1] are computed for a specified day.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Solar energy is an important input parameter in different models concerning 
energy industry, landscape, vegetation, evapotranspiration, snowmelt or remote
sensing. Solar rays incidence angle maps can be effectively used in radiometric
and topographic corrections in mountainous and hilly terrain where very accurate
investigations should be performed. 
<p>
The clear-sky solar radiation model applied in the r.heliosat is based on the
work undertaken for development of European Solar Radiation Atlas (Rigollier 2001).
The clear sky model estimates the global radiation from the sum of its beam, diffuse and reflected components.
